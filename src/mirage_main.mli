(** Portable shim for MirageOS APIs

    You can open this module in a Mirage unikernel to gain access to the core OS
    services. The implementation is resolved implicitly at link-time.

    {b Note} This is a very special facility, designed to help other {e core}
    Mirage components avoid pervasive functorization. When in doubt, do {e not}
    use it.

      time. The functions registered with [at_exit] will be called when
      the program terminates, either normally or because of an uncaught
      exception.

      The functions are called in 'last in, first out' order: the
      function most recently added with [at_exit] is called first. *)
